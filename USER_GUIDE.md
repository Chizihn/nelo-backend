## 🌐 **ENS Basenames**

### **Setting Your Basename**

```
You: "set basename john"
Nelo: "🌐 Checking availability...

      ❌ 'john.base.eth' is taken

      • john_ng.base.eth ✅"

You: "set basename johnnelo"
Nelo: "✅ Basename Set Successfully!

      🌐 Your address: johnnelo.base.eth
      📧 Wallet: 0x742d...8f2a

      💡 Share your basename: johnnelo.base.eth"
```

### **Using Basenames**

- **Receive Money**: Share "yourname.base.eth" instead of phone number
- **Send Money**: "send 1000 friendname.base.eth"
- **Professional**: Use for business transactions
- **Memorable**: Easy for customers to remember

### **Basename Rules**
